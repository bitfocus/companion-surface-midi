# companion-surface-midi

See [HELP.md](./companion/HELP.md) and [LICENSE](./LICENSE)

## Getting started

Executing a `yarn` command should perform all necessary steps to develop the module, if it does not then follow the steps below.

The module can be built once with `yarn build`. This should be enough to get the module to be loadable by companion.

While developing the module, by using `yarn dev` the compiler will be run in watch mode to recompile the files on change.

### Notes

The port names vary in format by platform;

- On linux: `Launchpad Mini:Launchpad Mini MIDI 1 24:0` is common
- On macos: TODO
- On windows: TODO
